# Monopoly.

This is the Monopoly board game, but in Python. To run this, just install the PyGame module and run `main.py`.

All the rules can be found (https://www.ultraboardgames.com/monopoly/game-rules.php "here").
Unfortunately, as of now, the following rules are not supported:
 - Extra rent (color groups, houses, hotels)
 - Having less than four players
